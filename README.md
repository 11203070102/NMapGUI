## Installation

For the moment, NMapGUI can't be installed, it's just a compressed java jar application.

So just go to the [releases page](https://github.com/danicuestasuarez/NMapGUI/releases) and download the latest zip, unzip it and enjoy NMapGUI!
On progress: Menu creation

## Usage

### Starting the application

For the moment, you will have to execute the jar file. If you have java properly configured in your Linux system, it should work just by double-clicking the jar file. Otherwise, you will have to launch it with your console. for that I recommend the following command: 
 
`nohup java -jar nmapGUI-0.3.1-snapshot.jar $`   

as it will let you close the console and still use the app.
